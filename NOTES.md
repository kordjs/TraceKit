# ‼️ inconsistent Github Releases

> Github release names are a bit all over the place.
> This is because releases made before integrating with release-it,
> Was not formatted like "v${version}" it was "${version}"
> Now there is multiple formats of release versions.

- The release format is: v[version]
  - e.g: v1.0.0
- Releases after: v2.1.1
  - Uses this format
